# PyCamp 04: Challenge week


## Introduction:

In week 3 you have talked with your teachers about your first progress. 
If everything is going well you will make a challenge assignment in this week, but it also possible that you experience difficulties, for example:
- you are behind schedule
- you have problems with planning
- you don't understand everything of python (learned so far)
- it is difficult to make a program on your own
- difficulties with english, math, dutch, concentration, motivation, ....

With help of your teachers you have made a **personal plan** for this week to solve this (not necessary 100%)
They will help you this week with specific problemes you encounter.

## Challenge: A Text Based Adventure

So far you learned the basics of python programming : variables, input, output, calculations, branching and looping.
Even with these simple techniques you can build a nice game : **A Text Based Adventure**.


To get an impression you could look at [this online reference](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/browser-text-based-games/) 


In short your challenge will be:
1. explore the world of TBA's.
2. practice a little with examples found on the internet.
3. develop a story for your adventure.
4. build your first TBA.
5. extend it with new features that you like.

### Hints:

1. Feel free to use other programming struture you already know.
2. You don't have to build a **web based** version. At this phase build a console-based game.
3. Zork is a famous TBA, but don't try to finish it ..... ! 
4. There are plenty of introductions:
	- [https://www.thecoderpedia.com/blog/text-based-adventure-game-in-python/](https://www.thecoderpedia.com/blog/text-based-adventure-game-in-python/)
	- [https://www.askpython.com/python/text-based-adventure-game](https://www.askpython.com/python/text-based-adventure-game)
	- You can easily find more examples.
5. Here you can use your creativity! We have chosen a **theme** for this year: **MOUNTENEERING**.
Some ideas (if you have a creativity block):
	- oxygen
	- food
	- water
	- snow, cold
	- avalanches
	- climbing material
	- yeti
	- ...... (the sky is the limit!)
6. Start with building a simple adventure first. Extend it later with (whatever you like to try):
	- sound
	- images
	- more puzzles
	- map of the environment


Enjoy Building.
