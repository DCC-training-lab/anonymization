# PyCamp 10: (Plain) Data Files

**Introduction**: This document presents learning activities for PyCamp 10. In PyCamp 10, you will get introduced with plain data files in Python. 

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 
- **ORef-01**: Online Tutorial; Charles Severance; "Python for Everybody"; [Available here](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html)
- **Exercises**: Available here [todo: finalise the link to the exercises file of week10].


## Path:

### Steps: Files and Content.

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 12**, **BRef-01: Chapter 14**, **ORef-01: Chapter 7** and **ORef-01: Chapter 11** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is encoding and decoding?
   2. How can we encode a string to bytes in Python? How can we decode some bytes to a string?
   3. What are text data and binary data? Experiment with some examples.
   4. Given an existing text file, how can we open and read the content in Python? What about a binary file?
   5. Given an existing text file, how can we open and add some new content? What about a binary file?
   6. Given an existing text file, how can we open and add search for an exact value? What about a binary file?
   7. Given an existing text file, how can we open and add search for a pattern using regular expression? 
   
2. Provide your solutions to the exercises of PyCamp 09. 

### Optional:
The follwoing concepts are not part of the main learning path, but can be considered as optional learning activities for those who seek more challenges:

### Final Product

1. Make a summary of concepts and techniques you have learned in this week.
2. Implement the products provided in PyCamp 10.
