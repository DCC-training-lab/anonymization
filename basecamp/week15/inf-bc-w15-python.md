# Python 15: Recursive Functions.

**Introduction**: This document presents learning activities for Python 15. In Python 15, you will learn and practice recurive functions in Python.

**Note**: In this phase, it is expected the learner can plan and run required learning process towards the goals of the week: making solutions to the given problems and product(s).

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 
- Free research.


## Path:

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. understand and apply recurive functions.
```
#### What to learn?

1. Using **BRef-01, Chapter 9** make a plan for the week to learn basics of Python programs interacting with relational databases.
	- Make an overview of the provided problems and final product.
	- Plan what you need to learn in order to provide your solutions.
	- Read proposed book chapter and practice basic steps.

## Problems:


1. Implement a recursive function named `rec_print(n)` that given a positive integer `n` prints all the positive numbers less than `n` in:
	- descending order
	- ascending order
2. [todo: classic, implement n!]
3. [todo: give a code for turtle drawing a line and turning left or right. Implement recursively to generate given spiral shape.]
