# PyCamp 11: Structured Data Files

**Introduction**: This document presents learning activities for PyCamp 11. In PyCamp 11, you will get introduced with files that contains more structured data values. 

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 
- **ORef-01**: Online Tutorial; Charles Severance; "Python for Everybody"; [Available here](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html)
- **Exercises**: Available here [todo: finalise the link to the exercises file of week11].


## Path:

### Steps: Tabular Text Files.

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 16** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is a csv file? How can one read the content of a csv file?
   2. What is a JSON file? How can one read the content of a JSON file?
   3. Given a csv file, how can we process the records? Experiment with an example where:
	   - a specific term is being searched
	   - the values of specific attributes for some records are extracted.
	   - the values of specific attributes for some records are modified.
   4. Given a JSON file, how can we process the objects? Experiment with an example where:
	   - the values of specific attributes for some objects are extracted.
	   - the values of specific attributes for some objects are modified.
   
2. Provide your solutions to the exercises of PyCamp 11. 

### Optional:
The follwoing concepts are not part of the main learning path, but can be considered as optional learning activities for those who seek more challenges:

- [todo: make an explicit list here]

### Final Product

1. Make a summary of concepts and techniques you have learned in this week.
2. Implement the products provided in PyCamp 11.
