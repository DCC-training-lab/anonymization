# Introduction

This collection covers a learning path for Basics of Python Programming. This learning path covers questions and acitivities around topics that are essential to learn basic elements of Python.

## Overview:

### Week01: Linear Programs.

- **Concepts** : General concepts of programs, basic data types, basic calculations in Python, linear programs in Python with simple input / output.
- **Exercises**: A list of candidate exercises is proposed where students practice simple linear programs with input and outputs.
- **Status**: 
	- *Learning Path*: Proof of Concept, ready to experiment.
	- *Exercises*: Proof of Concept, ready to experiment. More can be added.
	- *Products*: To do.

### Week02: Branching Programs.

- **Concepts** : Boolean expressions and conditional statements, basics of string processing with simple input / output.
- **Exercises**: Exercises from *Week01* will be extended with conditions and simple string processings. Students at this week can practice to prevent some invalid inputs from the user (first step in testing programs). New ideas can be added to the exercises.
- **Status**:
