<summary>Learning Outcomes:</summary>

**Programming Elements**: In **Part One** the following programming elements are covered:

	- primitive data types: characters, strings, integer, float and booleans.
	- basic numerical operations: + , - , * , / , %
	- simple user inputs and print formats.
	- conditional statements: if-else statements
	- loops: while and for.
	- basic string processing: length, split, join, replace, join.

As a result of participating in **PyCamp:Part One**, students will be able to:

1. Read, Understand and Analyse the behaviour of a Python program implementing the programming elements covered in Part One.
2. Implement their solutions for a given problem statement using the programming elements covered in Part One.
3. Execute basic commands (mkdir, cd, ls, rm, cp, mv) in terminal to structure their programming exercises.
4. Execute Python programs using a terminal and an IDE.
5. Follow and execute daily learning activities.
