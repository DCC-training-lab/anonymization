# Introduction

This collection covers a learning path for Basics of Python Programming. This learning path covers questions and acitivities around topics that are essential to learn basic elements of Python.

## Overview:

### Week01: Linear Programs.

- **Concepts** : General concepts of programs, basic data types, basic calculations in Python, linear programs in Python with simple input / output.
- **Exercises**: A list of candidate exercises is proposed where students practice simple linear programs with input and outputs.
- **Status**: 
	- *Learning Path*: Proof of Concept, ready to experiment.
	- *Exercises*: Proof of Concept, ready to experiment. More can be added.
