# PyCamp 06: Functions, Dictionaries and Sets.

**Introduction**: This document presents learning activities for PyCamp 06. In PyCamp 06, you will learn dictionaries to collect keys and coresponding values. Moreover, in this PyCamp you will learn more about functions. 

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 
- **ORef-01**: Online Tutorial; Charles Severance; "Python for Everybody"; [Available here](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html)
- **OPyEditor**: Online Editor for Programming; "Online Python (with shell and file storing functionalities)"; [Available here](https://www.online-python.com/)
- **Exercises**: Available here [todo: finalise the link to the exercises file of week06].


## Path:

**Note:** In PyCamp 06, exercises of can be done using:

1. Local Python Package (see PyCamp 01:Step-00).


### Step-01: Dictinaries.

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 08** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is a dictionary in Python and how can you create a dictionary?
   2. How can items be added/changed to/in a dictionary?
   3. How can you get the value of a given key? 
   4. What are the behaviour of these functions: *keys()*, *values()*, *items()*?
   5. When can we use *del*, *pop()* and *clear()*? Experiment with some examples.
   5. How can one iterate over a dictionary?
2. Provide your solutions to the exercises of PyCamp 06: Step-01. **ORef-01: Dictionary** can be used as extra learning reference.

### Step-02: Functions (more).

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 09** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What are the positional arguments in Python? What about keyword arguments?
   2. How can one define default values for function parameters? 
   3. What are Docstrings? How can they be helpful?
2. Provide your solutions to the exercises of PyCamp 06: Step-02. 

### Step-03: Sets.

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 08** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is a set in Python and how is it defined?
   2. How can one add/remove elements to/from a set?
   3. How can one iterate over a set?
   4. Assume two sets S1 and S2. How can one specify the following operations on S1 and S2:
	   - Intersection of S1 and S2.
	   - Union of S1 and S2.
	   - Difference S1 and S2.
	   - Is S1 a subset of S2 (or vice-versa)? 
2. Provide your solutions to the exercises of PyCamp 06: Step-03.

### Step-04: Final Product

1. Make a summary of concepts and techniques you have learned in this week.
2. Implement the products provided in PyCamp 06: Step-04.
