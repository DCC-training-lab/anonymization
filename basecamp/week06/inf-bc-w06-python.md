# Python 06: Functions, Dictionaries and Sets.

**Introduction**: This document presents learning activities for Python 06. In Python 06, you will learn dictionaries to collect keys and coresponding values. Moreover, you will learn more about functions. 

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 
- **ORef-01**: Online Tutorial; Charles Severance; "Python for Everybody"; [Available here](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html)


## Path:

### Step-01: 
#### Dictinaries.

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 08** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is a dictionary in Python and how can you create a dictionary?
   2. How can items be added/changed to/in a dictionary?
   3. How can you get the value of a given key? 
   4. What are the behaviour of these functions: *keys()*, *values()*, *items()*?
   5. When can we use *del*, *pop()* and *clear()*? Experiment with some examples.
   6. How can one iterate over a dictionary?

#### Exercises:   
1. Provide your solutions to the exercises of Python 06: Step-01. **ORef-01: Dictionary** can be used as extra learning reference.

### Step-02: 
#### Functions (more).

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 09** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What are the positional arguments in Python? What about keyword arguments?
   2. How can one define default values for function parameters? 
   3. What are Docstrings? How can they be helpful?

### Step-03: 
#### Sets.

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 08** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is a set in Python and how is it defined?
   2. How can one add/remove elements to/from a set?
   3. How can one iterate over a set?
   4. Assume two sets S1 and S2. How can one specify the following operations on S1 and S2:Python
	   - Intersection of S1 and S2.
	   - Union of S1 and S2.
	   - Difference S1 and S2.
	   - Is S1 a subset of S2 (or vice-versa)? 
2. Provide your solutions to the exercises of Python 06: Step-03.
