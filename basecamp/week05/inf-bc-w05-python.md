# PyCamp 05: [todo: a proper title]

**Introduction**: This document presents learning activities for PyCamp 05. In PyCamp 05, you will learn basics of functions to oraganise your large programs. A function is a fragment of code with a name to be reused in different places of the program. Moreover, in this PyCamp you will learn how to build a sequence structure using basic data types.

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 
- **ORef-01**: Online Tutorial; Charles Severance; "Python for Everybody"; [Available here](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html)
- **OPyEditor**: Online Editor for Programming; "Online Python (with shell and file storing functionalities)"; [Available here](https://www.online-python.com/)


## Path:

**Note:** In PyCamp 05, exercises of can be done using:

1. Local Python Package (see PyCamp 01:Step-00).


### Step-01: What is a function?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 09** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is a function in Python?
   2. What are the main elements of a Python function? Define a simple function that does nothing.
   3. How can a function be used (called)? 
   4. How can one return the result of a function?
   5. What are the arguments and/or parameters?
2. Provide your solutions to the exercises of PyCamp 05: Step-01. **ORef-01: Functions** can be used as extra learning reference.

### Step-02: Tuples.

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 07** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is a tuple in Python and how is it defined?
   2. How can one combine and compare two (or more) tuples? 
   3. How can one iterate over the elements of a tuple?
   4. How is a tuple modified?
2. Provide your solutions to the exercises of PyCamp 05: Step-02. 

### Step-03: Lists.

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 07** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is a tuple in Python and how is it defined?
   2. What is the result of *split()* on a string?
   3. There are two ways to get items from a list: offset and slice. What are the pros / cons of each. Experiment with some examples.
   4. How can you add new elements to a list?
   5. How can you modify elements of a list?
   6. *Mutability* is one of the main differences between a tuple and a list. Elaborate this with some example. 
2. Provide your solutions to the exercises of PyCamp 05: Step-03.

### Step-04: Final Product

1. Make a summary of concepts and techniques you have learned in this week.
2. Implement the products provided in PyCamp 05: Step-04.
