# PyCamp 09: Everything is an Object.

**Introduction**: This document presents learning activities for PyCamp 09. In PyCamp 09, you will get introduced with classes and objects in Python. 

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 
- **ORef-01**: Online Tutorial; Charles Severance; "Python for Everybody"; [Available here](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html)
- **Exercises**: Available here [todo: finalise the link to the exercises file of week02].


## Path:

### Steps: Class and Object.

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 10** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is an Object in Python?
   2. What is a class and how can you define a class in Python? Make an example.
   3. How can you create and use an object from a class? Experiment with examples.
   4. What are attributes? How they help programmers to encapsulate their data values?
   5. What is a method? Focus only on *instance methods*.
   5. How can you initialize an instance (object)? Implement a class with **__init__** method.
   
2. Provide your solutions to the exercises of PyCamp 09.
