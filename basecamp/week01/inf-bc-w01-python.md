# Python 01: Linear Programs.

**Introduction**: This document presents learning activities for Python 01. In Python 01, you will learn first elements of Python to build your first interactive linear program. We define a linear program as a flow of sequential instructions without branching and loops. At the end of Python 01, you will be able to implement a program where a user can enter simple input(s), the program calculates and prints the results as its output.

**Note:** In Python 01, exercises and examples can be executed using:

1. Online Python Editor **OPyEditor**: The final program should be stored in local machine.
2. Local Python Package (see ExtraStep-01): Using **BRef-01: Appendix B** Python can be installed in your local machine.

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 
- **ORef-01**: Online Tutorial; Charles Severance; "Python for Everybody"; [Available here](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html)
- **OPyEditor**: Online Editor for Programming; "Online Python (with shell and file storing functionalities)"; [Available here](https://www.online-python.com/)

## Path:

Follow the following steps:

### Step-01: 
#### What is a Program?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 01** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is a general definition of a program? Provide some (none-computer) examples.
   2. What are the main elements of a program?
   3. Take some simple python programs and try to guess what each program does. Discuss inputs, behaviour and expected outputs.
   4. Find a python program. Name five different syntactical elements of the program. Define semantics of two elements of the program.

#### Exercises:

1. Finish all the exercises listed in **BRef-01-Chapter 01: Things to Do**.
2. [todo: choose / add the exercises suitable for this step]

### Step-02: 

#### Everything starts with Data.

1. Perform a free (re-)search and explore the following answers:
   1. What are the main hardware elements of a computer?
   2. What is an Operating System and why do we need it?
   3. How data (values) are stored / extracted / computed in a computer? *Hint: explore concepts of bytes, bits, ram memory, hard disks, cpu registers.*
2. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 02** explore the answers for the folowwing questions: *(Note: There are some concepts that students may not be able to grasp completely. The main idea is to try as much as possible. It will be more clear for the students later when they learn OO programming in Python)*
   1. What is a value? What is a variable?
   2. What is a *type*? Provide five examples.
   3. How can you define a variable in Python? 
   4. Define some variables in Python that are not permitted in Python. Experiment with breaking various rules in defining variables. Analyse the error message.
   5. How can you assign a value to a variable? How can we express that two items are equal?
   6. How can you identify the type of a value / variable?
3. Perform a free (re)-search and answer the following questions:
   1. What are the character and string types in Python? Make examples.
   2. You have learned how to print something as an output of your program. How can you read something as input? What is the function? What is the type?


#### Exercises:

1. Finish all the exercises listed in **BRef-01-Chapter 02: Things to Do**.

### Step-03: How to Calculate?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 03** answer the following questions:
   1. Name basic built-in data types in Python. Use examples.
   2. What are the basic arithmetic operations? Make a list with the semantics of each operation.
   3. Why *precedences* are important? Make examples.
   4. How can you convert one data type to another? Name basic built-in functions.

## Problems:


Implement Python programs to solve the following problem statements:

1. Implement a program that given number of years as input prints the number of months and days as output.
2. Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her name. The program should respond with a message that says hello to the user, using his or her name.
3. Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once the values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the room. The length and the width will be entered as floating point numbers. Include units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which unit you are more comfortable working with.
4. The program that you create for this exercise will begin by reading the cost of a meal ordered at a restaurant from the user. Then your program will compute the tax and tip for the meal. Use your local tax rate when computing the amount of tax owing. Compute the tip as 18 percent of the meal amount (without the tax). The output from your program should include the tax amount, the tip amount, and the grand total for the meal including both the tax and the tip.
5. An online retailer sells two products: widgets and gizmos. Each widget weighs 75 grams. Each gizmo weighs 112 grams. Write a program that reads the number of widgets and the number of gizmos in an order from the user. Then your program should compute and display the total weight of the order.
6.  Develop a program that reads a four-digit integer from the user and displays the sum of the digits in the number. For example, if the user enters 3141 then your program should display 3+1+4+1=9.
7. Implement a program that a user enters number of days as input, and the program prints number of hours, minutes and seconds separately as output.
8. [todo: add more ...]


## Extra Steps:

### ExtraStep-01: Set Up Python
1. Using **BRef-01: Appendix B** perform the following tasks:
   1. Install Python on your machine.
   2. Open a terminal (command window) and check the version of your Python. What is the command?
   3. Create a file and name it: hello.py (make sure the extension of the file is py). Open the file and use print statement to print a given text, like Hello Python. Save the file and using your terminal execute your first python program.
