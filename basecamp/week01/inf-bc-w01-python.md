# PyCamp 01: Linear Programs

**Introduction**: This document presents learning activities for PyCamp 01. In PyCamp 01, you will learn basics of Python to build a linear program. A linear program is a flow of sequential instructions without branching and loops. At the end this PyCamp, you will be able to implement a program where a user can enter simple input, the program calculates and prints the results as output.

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 
- **ORef-01**: Online Tutorial; Charles Severance; "Python for Everybody"; [Available here](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html)
- **OPyEditor**: Online Editor for Programming; "Online Python (with shell and file storing functionalities)"; [Available here](https://www.online-python.com/)
- **Exercises**: Available here [todo: finalise the link to the exercises file of week01].


## Path:

**Note:** In PyCamp 01, exercises and examples can be executed using:

1. Online Python Editor **OPyEditor**: The final program should be stored in local machine.
2. Local Python Package (see Step-00): Using **BRef-01: Appendix B** Python can be installed in your local machine.

Follow the following steps:

### Step-00 *(Optional)*: Set up
1. Using **BRef-01: Appendix B** perform the following tasks:
   1. Install Python on your machine.
   2. Open a terminal (command window) and check the version of your Python. What is the command?
   3. Create a file and name it: hello.py (make sure the extension of the file is py). Open the file and use print statement to print a given text, like Hello Python. Save the file and using your terminal execute your first python program.


### Step-01: What is a Program?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 01** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is a general definition of a program? Provide some (none-computer) examples.
   2. What are the main elements of a program?
   3. Take some simple python programs and try to guess what each program does. Discuss inputs, behaviour and expected outputs.
   4. Find a python program. Name five different syntactical elements of the program. Define semantics of two elements of the program.
2. Practice with the provided **Exercises**. 


### Step-02: Everything starts with Data.

1. Perform a free (re-)search and explore the following answers:
   1. What are the main hardware elements of a computer?
   2. What is an Operating System and why do we need it?
   3. How data (values) are stored / extracted / computed in a computer? *Hint: explore concepts of bytes, bits, ram memory, hard disks, cpu registers.*
2. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 02** explore the answers for the folowwing questions: *(Note: There are some concepts that students may not be able to grasp completely. The main idea is to try as much as possible. It will be more clear for the students later when they learn OO programming in Python)*
   1. What is a value? What is a variable?
   2. What is a *type*? Provide five examples.
   3. How can you define a variable in Python? 
   4. Define some variables in Python that are not permitted in Python. Experiment with breaking various rules in defining variables. Analyse the error message.
   5. How can you assign a value to a variable? How can we express that two items are equal?
   6. How can you identify the type of a value / variable?
3. Perform a free (re)-search and answer the following questions:
   1. What are the character and string types in Python? Make examples.
   2. You have learned how to print something as an output of your program. How can you read something as input? What is the function? What is the type?
4. Practice with the provided **Exercises**.

### Step-03: How to Calculate?


1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 03** answer the following questions:
   1. Name basic built-in data types in Python. Use examples.
   2. What are the basic arithmetic operations? Make a list with the semantics of each operation.
   3. Why *precedences* are important? Make examples.
   4. How can you convert one data type to another? Name basic built-in functions.
2. Practice with the provided **Exercises**.

### Step-04: Final Product

1. Make a summary of concepts and techniques you have learned in this week.
2. Implement the products based on the descriptions provided in the **Exercises**.
