2. Implement a program (name **days-to-hms.py**) that a user can: (1) enter number of days as input, and (2) prints number of hours, minutes and seconds separately as output.
3. Experiment the behaviour of **days-to-hms.py** when: (1) input is a negative number, (2) input is a mix of letters and numbers.

### Exercises

1. Implement a program that given number of years as input prints the number of months and days as output (see **bc-w01-ex001.py**).
2. Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her name. The program should respond with a message that says hello to the user, using his or her name (see **bc-w01-ex002.py**).
3. Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once the values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the room. The length and the width will be entered as floating point numbers. Include units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which unit you are more comfortable working with (see **bc-w01-ex003.py**).
4. The program that you create for this exercise will begin by reading the cost of a meal ordered at a restaurant from the user. Then your program will compute the tax and tip for the meal. Use your local tax rate when computing the amount of tax owing. Compute the tip as 18 percent of the meal amount (without the tax). The output from your program should include the tax amount, the tip amount, and the grand total for the meal including both the tax and the tip (see **bc-w01-ex004.py**).
5. An online retailer sells two products: widgets and gizmos. Each widget weighs 75 grams. Each gizmo weighs 112 grams. Write a program that reads the number of widgets and the number of gizmos in an order from the user. Then your program should compute and display the total weight of the order (see **bc-w01-ex005.py**).
6.  Develop a program that reads a four-digit integer from the user and displays the sum of the digits in the number. For example, if the user enters 3141 then your program should display 3+1+4+1=9 (see **bc-w01-ex006.py**).
