# PyCampPyCamp 02: Branching Programs

**Introduction**: This document presents learning activities for PyCamp 02. In PyCamp 02, you will learn basics of Python structures to add decision points to your linear programs. A branching program is a flow of sequential instructions with branching statements. By the end this PyCamp, you will be able to implement a program where a user can enter simple input, the program can make choices based on some conditions and after calculation results can be printed as output.

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 
- **OPyEditor**: Online Editor for Programming; "Online Python (with shell and file storing functionalities)"; [Available here](https://www.online-python.com/)
- **Exercises**: Available here [todo: finalise the link to the exercises file of week02].

## Path:

**Note:** Exercises of this learning path can be done using:

1. Online Python Editor **OPyEditor**: The final program should be stored in local machine.
2. Local Python Package (see Step-00): Using **BRef-01: Appendix B** Python can be installed in your local machine.

Follow the following steps:

### Step-01: Set up
1. Using **BRef-01: Appendix B** perform the following tasks:
   1. Install Python on your machine.
   2. Open a terminal (command window) and check the version of your Python. What is the command?
   3. Create a file and name it: hello.py (make sure the extension of the file is py). Open the file and use print statement to print a given text, like Hello Python. Save the file and using your terminal execute your first python program.


### Step-02: How to check conditions?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 04** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is a comment and how you can specify a comment in Python?
   2. What are boolean values, boolean expressions, comparison operators and conditional statement in Python?
2. Practice with the provided **Exercises**.
   
### Step-03: Strings are essential.

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 05** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. How can you combine several strings? Implement an example.
   2. Can you multiply a number with a string? What is the result? Implement an example.
   3. How can you get character 5 of a given string? How can you get the first character?
   4. How can you get a substring?
2. Practice with the provided **Exercises**.
    

### Step-04: Final Product

1. Make a summary of concepts and techniques you have learned in this PyCamp.
2. Implement the following products based on their descriptions:
