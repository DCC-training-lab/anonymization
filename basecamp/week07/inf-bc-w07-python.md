# Python 07: Functions and Collective Structures.

**Introduction**: This document presents learning activities for Python 07. In Python 07, you will learn more in depth about tuples, lists, dictionaris and functions. 

**Note:** Exercises of this learning path must be done using:

1. IDE: Using **BRef-01: Chapter 19, Section: Integrated Development Environment** PyCharm can be installed in your local machine.


## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:
Python
- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 
- **ORef-01**: Online Tutorial; Charles Severance; "Python for Everybody"; [Available here](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html)


## Path:

### Step-01: Functions (more).

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. interpret and implement Python programs with Python functions: [todo].
```

#### What to Learn?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 09** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. "Functions are first-class citizens": What does this sentence mean?
   2. What is an anonymous function and how can you define it in Python? Experiment with some examples.
   3. What are *namespace* and *scope*? What is the scope of a function? Use examples to justofy your answers. 

#### Exercises:

1. [todo]
2. Design two exercises of your own. They should improve understanding topics of this step.
3. If you don't have PyCharm yet, install *PyCharm* on your working machine. Implement and run a simple Python program of your choice. 
	- It is important to learn how to create a new Python program, how to configure interpreter and how to run the program. Where do you see the results?

### Step-02: Tuples and Lists (more).

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. interpret and implement Python programs with Python Tuples and Lists: [todo].
```

#### What to Learn?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 07** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. We have learned *join()* on a string. How does *join()* work in a list?
   2. How can we sort items of a list? Is this possible on a tuple?
   3. There are several ways to copy a list: *list(), clicing, copy()* and *deepcopy()*. Experiment different expamples for each technique.
   4. How can one build a list using *list comprehension*? Do we have *tuple comprehension*?

#### Exercises:
1. [todo]
2. Design two exercises of your own. They should improve understanding topics of this step.

### Step-03: Dictionaries and Sets (more).

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. interpret and implement Python programs with Python Dictionaries and Sets: [todo].
```

#### What to Learn?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 08** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. How do *copy()* and *deepcopy()* behave on dictionaries? What about sets?
   2. How does *dictionary comprehension* work? What about sets?
   3. Try to build the following nested structures:
	   - List of lists.
	   - Tuple of lists.
	   - Tuple of tuples.
	   - List of tuples 

#### Exercises:
1. [todo]
2. Design two exercises of your own. They should improve understanding topics of this step.
