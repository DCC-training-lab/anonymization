# PyCamp 07: Functions and Collective Structures.

**Introduction**: This document presents learning activities for PyCamp 07. In PyCamp 07, you will learn more in depth about tuples, lists, dictionaris and functions. 

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 
- **ORef-01**: Online Tutorial; Charles Severance; "Python for Everybody"; [Available here](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html)
- **OPyEditor**: Online Editor for Programming; "Online Python (with shell and file storing functionalities)"; [Available here](https://www.online-python.com/)


## Path:

### Step-01: Functions (more).

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 09** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. "Functions are first-class citizens": What does this sentence mean?
   2. What is an anonymous function and how can you define it in Python? Experiment with some examples.
   3. What are *namespace* and *scope*? What is the scope of a function? Use examples to justofy your answers. 
2. Provide your solutions to the exercises of PyCamp 07: Step-01. 

### Step-02: Tuples and Lists (more).

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 07** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. We have learned *join()* on a string. How does *join()* work in a list?
   2. How can we sort items of a list? Is this possible on a tuple?
   3. There are several ways to copy a list: *list(), clicing, copy()* and *deepcopy()*. Experiment different expamples for each technique.
   4. How can one build a list using *list comprehension*? Do we have *tuple comprehension*?
2. Provide your solutions to the exercises of PyCamp 07: Step-02. 

### Step-03: Dictionaries and Sets (more).

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 08** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. How do *copy()* and *deepcopy()* behave on dictionaries? What about sets?
   2. How does *dictionary comprehension* work? What about sets?
   3. Try to build the following nested structures:
	   - List of lists.
	   - Tuple of lists.
	   - Tuple of tuples.
	   - List of tuples 
2. Provide your solutions to the exercises of PyCamp 07: Step-03.

### Step-04: Final Product

1. Make a summary of concepts and techniques you have learned in this week.
2. Implement the products provided in PyCamp 07: Step-04.
