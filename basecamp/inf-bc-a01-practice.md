# Code Reading Practices:

## Code Reading:


### Syntax and Semantic
Follow these steps:

1. Print out (or make a pdf version of) the code.
2. Read the codes and fill the tables below.
3. Search unknown elements and try to find out the answers.
4. Corss table rows that become clear and familiar.
5. Share your final tables with your study group.
6. Discuss about remaining unknown table rows.

| Code Statement | Unknown Syntax | Unknown Semantic |
|------------------|----------------| ----|
| | |
| | |


### Variables and Values

Follow these steps:

1. Print out (or make a pdf version of) the code.
2. Circle around the first appearances of the variables.
3. Choose one of the variables and underline the later appearances in the code.
4. Scribble intermediate values next to the selected variable.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for other variables.

### Refactoring

[todo: very useful for practicing functions, replacing unfamiliar pieces of the code like lambda expressions]

**Definition**: Refactoring is a rewriting of code with the purpose of improving some aspects (readability, structure, avoiding duplications, etc) without changing the (external) behaviour and final results.

**Cognitive Refactoring**: A refactoring where maintainability and efficiency are not the main goals but the main purpose is to improve code readability and understandability. 


Follow these steps:

1. Take a code (snippet).
2. Select some lines (can be the whole) of the code.
3. Refactor the selected lines.
4. Share refactored code with study group members and compare how different programmers refactored the code.

### Creating A Dependency Graph

Follow these steps:
[todo: from page 57, we can define various exercises: flow of variables, functions, lists, classes and instances, ]
[todo: perhaps all the above steps in one large piece of the code with different colors]

### Visualising Code Execution

[todo: use this website and visualise executions, more suitable when objects, instances and memory is involved: https://pythontutor.com/]

### Dependency Graph and State Table: combined

[todo: check page 61]
