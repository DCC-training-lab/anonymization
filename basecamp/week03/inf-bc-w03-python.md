# PyCamp 03: Iterative Programs

**Introduction**: This document presents learning steps for PyCamp 03. In PyCamp 03, you will learn basics of strings in PythonPyCamp and required structures to add repetition points to your programs. An iterative program is a flow of sequential instructions with repeating statements. By the end this PyCamp, you will be able to implement a program where a user can have simple interactions: the user repeatedly enters simple input, the program calculats the results and prints the result in output.

## Materials:

The learning steps are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 
- **OPyEditor**: Online Editor for Programming; "Online Python (with shell and file storing functionalities)"; [Available here](https://www.online-python.com/)
- **Exercises**: Available here [todo: finalise the link to the exercises file of week03].


## Path:

**Note:** During this PyCamp can be done using:

1. Online Python Editor **OPyEditor**: The final program should be stored in local machine.
2. Local Python Package: Using **BRef-01: Appendix B** Python can be installed in your local machine.

Follow the following steps:

### Step-01: Strings

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 05** experiment and answer the following questions:
   1. What is string data type?
   2. Which Python built-in function can be used to convert a data type to string? Try some examples in Python shell.
   3. In Python (and some other programing langiages), special characters can mean differently in a string. How one can specify these special characters in a Python program? List some of these characters and try the examples in Python shell.
   4. How one can concatenate multiple strings? Make one string with your: First name, Last name, student number and group number.
   5. What would be the result of multiplying a number with a string? Try three examples. What if the number is zero?
   6. How can you extract specific character from a given string? How can you specify the first character? Last character? How can you get a slice if a string? Try with several examples in Python shell.
   7. What are the functionality of functions: *len()*, *split()*, *join()*, *replace()*. Try two examples for each function in Python shell.
2. Practice with the provided **Exercises**.

### Step-02: Looping with *while*

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 06** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. A *while* loop consists of a condition and a body. Pick and example from **BRef-01: Chapter 06** and specify the condition and the body of the program.
   2. Using *while* loop implement a program that prints a message (like *Hello*) for 10 times.
   3. Using *while* loop implement a counter that counts down from 10 until 0. In each iteration, the program must print the value of the counter.
   4. What is *break* statement? 
   5. Implement a program that repeatedly asks the user to enter a character as input until the user enters *q*. If the user enters *q* the program will stop. 
2. Practice with the provided **Exercises**.

### Step-03: Looping with *for .. in*

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 06** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. [todo: very similar to Step-02: design some activities.]
2. Practice with the provided **Exercises**.
    

### Step-04: Final Product

1. Make a summary of concepts and techniques you have learned in this PyCamp.
2. Practice with the provided **Exercises**.
