# In this exercise you will create a program that displays a multiplication table
# that shows the products of all combinations of integers
# from 1 times 1 up to and including 10 times 10.
# Your multiplication table should include a row of labels
# across the top of it containing the numbers 1 through 10.
# It should also include labels down the left side consisting of the numbers 1 through 10.
