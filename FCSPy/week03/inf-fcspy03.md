# Week 03

True or False? The result of decisions can change the path of the executions in a program. What are the fundamental concepts to formulate decisions in computer programs? What is the theory behind it? In this week we will explore branching algorithms and rules to analyse truthness of an expression.

## Learning Outcomes

After this lesson each student will be able to:

1. Understand and evaluate boolean logic expressions.
2. Understand and apply De Morgan's Laws to simplify Python boolean expressions.
3. Understand and implement conditional statements in Python.

## Learning Activities:

Using provided material, explore and discuss the following questions:

1. What is a boolean data type in Python? What is a boolean expression in Python? 
2. Make a list of boolean *operators* in Python. Write down at least one examples for each.
3. Make a list of (main) operators in *boolean logic*. Write down at least one examples for each.
4. What is a truth table? Construct truth tables for the following boolean operators: `AND` (conjunction $\wedge$), `OR` (disjunction $\wee$), `NOT` (negation $\neg$), `XOR`, `IMPL`(implication $\implies$).
5. How do two boolean expressions become *equivalent*? 
6. Make a list of comparison operators in Python and math. Write down at least one examples for each.
7. What is a conditional statement in Python and how it can be used to implement branching algorithms?
8. Construct a table of De Morgan's Laws. Write down one example for each. 
9. How De Morgan's Laws can be used to simplify boolean expressions?
