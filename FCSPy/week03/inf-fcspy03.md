# Week 03

Often we need to repeat some actions. How do design algorithms with repeating statements? In this week we will explore loops.

## Learning Outcomes

After this lesson each student will be able to:
1. design and implement iterations and cyclic algorithms.

## Learning Activities

Using provided material, explore and discuss the following questions:

1. What is a cyclic algorithm?
2. What are the main element of a while-loop in Python?
3. What are the main elements of a for-loop in Python?
4. How do we implement a cyclic algorithm in Python?
