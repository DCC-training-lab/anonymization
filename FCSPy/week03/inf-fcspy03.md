# Week 03

True or False? The result of decisions can change the path of the executions in a program. What are the fundamental concepts to formulate decisions in computer programs? What is the theory behind it? In this week we will explore branching algorithms and rules to analyse truthness of an expression.

## Learning Outcomes

Practicing this lesson each student will be able to:
[todo]
1. Learning objectives:
Get acquainted with logic and Boolean logic, terms and definitions,
Learn Boolean logic operators
Evaluate Boolean expressions using truth tables

At the end of the lesson a student should be able to:
Model a problem using Boolean notation
Use Boolean logic operators and truth tables to solve a problem

2. Understand the basic components of a computer and its basic operations.
3. Understand what is software and different types of softwares.
4. Understand and implement basic arithmetic operations in Python.
5. Understand and implement simple Python programs with `input` and `print`.
6. Understand three number formats and convert them to each other: `decimal`, `binary` and `hexadecimal`.

## Learning Activities:

Using provided material, explore and discuss the following questions:

1. What is a boolean data type in Python? What is a boolean expression in Python? 
2. Make a list of boolean *operators* in Python. Write down at least one examples for each.
3. Make a list of (main) operators in *boolean logic*. Write down at least one examples for each.
4. What is a truth table? Construct truth tables for the following boolean operators: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `XOR`, `IMPL`($\implies$) 
3. Describe the *Computer Science* descipline. How about *Software Engineering*, *Data Science*, *Computer Engineering*, *Information Technologies*?
4. What is a *computer*? What are the main activities within a computer? What are the main building blocks of a computer? Hine: Use *von Neumann* architecture as your reference model.
5. What is a *software*? Describe these terminologies: *Hardware*, *System Software* and *Application Software*. Support your answers with several examples.
6. Describe *analog information* and *digital information*. Give examples.
7. Describe *encoding* and *decoding*. Elaborate your answers with examples.
8. What is an *algorithm* and a *computer program*? Support your answers with examples.
9. Make a list of arithmetic operations in Python and try some examples in your Python environment (shell).
10. Make a list of primitive data types in Python. How can you convert one type to another? Provide examples.
11. How can you ask a user to enter an input value? How can you print a message or result of a calculation in output?
12. There are three main number formats: `decimal`, `binary` and `hexadecimal`. Give three examples for each. How can you convert one to another?

## Exercises:

1. What is the biggest a) binary, b) decimal, c) hexadecimal number, that you can write with one digit?
2. What is the biggest a) binary, b) decimal, c) hexadecimal number, that you can write with two digits? 
3. How can you (quickly) determine if a binary number is odd or even?
4. Convert the following binary numbers to decimal: 101, 10011, 11010010
5. Convert the following hexadecimal numbers to decimal: 42, 2F, C02
6. Convert the following decimal numbers to hexadecimal: 42, 300
7. Convert the following decimal numbers to binary: 5, 20
