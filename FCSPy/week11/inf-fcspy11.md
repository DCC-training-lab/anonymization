# Week 01

We always hear about data, information and computers processing data. But what are those exactly? What are the main elements of a device to call it as a computer? How can data be represented in various format? Answering to these questions will help us take first steps in learning fundations of Computer Science.

## Learning Outcomes:

Practicing this lesson each student will be able to:

1. Understand the basic terminology of data and information (digital vs analog).
2. Understand the basic components of a computer and its basic operations.
3. Understand what is software and different types of softwares.
4. Understand and implement basic arithmetic operations in Python.
5. Understand and implement simple Python programs with `input` and `print`.
6. Understand three number formats and convert them to each other: `decimal`, `binary` and `hexadecimal`.

## Learning Activities:

Using provided material, explore and discuss the following questions:

1. What is *data* and *information*? Justify your answres using a few examples.
2. Describe the *Information Science* descipline. What are the main information-related activities in this descipline?
3. Describe the *Computer Science* descipline. How about *Software Engineering*, *Data Science*, *Computer Engineering*, *Information Technologies*?
4. What is a *computer*? What are the main activities within a computer? What are the main building blocks of a computer? Hine: Use *von Neumann* architecture as your reference model.
5. What is a *software*? Describe these terminologies: *Hardware*, *System Software* and *Application Software*. Support your answers with several examples.
6. Describe *analog information* and *digital information*. Give examples.
7. Describe *encoding* and *decoding*. Elaborate your answers with examples.
8. What is an *algorithm* and a *computer program*? Support your answers with examples.
9. Make a list of arithmetic operations in Python and try some examples in your Python environment (shell).
10. Make a list of primitive data types in Python. How can you convert one type to another? Provide examples.
11. How can you ask a user to enter an input value? How can you print a message or result of a calculation in output?
12. There are three main number formats: `decimal`, `binary` and `hexadecimal`. Give three examples for each. How can you convert one to another?

## Exercises:

1. What is the biggest a) binary, b) decimal, c) hexadecimal number, that you can write with one digit?
2. What is the biggest a) binary, b) decimal, c) hexadecimal number, that you can write with two digits? 
3. How can you (quickly) determine if a binary number is odd or even?
4. Convert the following binary numbers to decimal: 101, 10011, 11010010
5. Convert the following hexadecimal numbers to decimal: 42, 2F, C02
6. Convert the following decimal numbers to hexadecimal: 42, 300
7. Convert the following decimal numbers to binary: 5, 20
